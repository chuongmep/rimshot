Rimshot is a collection of features that touch multiple parts of your technology. These are arranged into '*topics*' (I'm regretting that choice of words.

Because each topic's functionality is dependant on the others, these are not 'packages' in the Speckle repo sense.

Current topics under development:

* Navisworks Adding
* Web UI
* Background enabling functions
* Firebase DB
* Chrome Extension

Documentation for each is included in each topic directory.
