## [R]ealtime [I]ssue [M]anagement with [S]peckle - HOT! ðŸ”¥

## Premise ##

During the Great Lockdown of the last two years, in what has so quickly become a remote-working, online-first-meetings, broadcast only way of doing business. One really striking aspect of the AECO world, away from the Teams, Google Docs, Zoom and the like, was that the manner of Model Analysis and review has not been in the same class of technological delivery.

I've sat through many dozens of streamed Navisworks sessions and engagement amongst teams has definitely waned.

For this professional/social need I introduce Rimshot - Realtime Issue Management with Speckle.

Utilising two aspects that I admire of Speckle: 

1. Information Hub and low-friction data transfer.
2. Bring people to the Model.

## Components ##

The hackathon submission consists of:

### An installed webview addin for Navisworks.

### An Issue Mangement workshop capture interface.

### A pattern for managing Model based issues within the Speckle interface.

## Roadmap Post Hackathon ##

* Proper linking with Auth flow and project/stream selection.
* Syncing of Comments between the two databases - near realtime.
* More responsive syncing. Allow Speckle to push to the app (perhaps closing out issues, 3rd party commits)
* Sorting out the ðŸ”¥HOT MESSðŸ”¥ of the Navisworks geometry translation.

* Integate the Speckle Viewer rather than embed views.
* Responsive Event driven model analysis to push metadata into the issue record.
